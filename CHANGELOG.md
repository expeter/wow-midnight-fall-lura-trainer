# L'ura Trainer changelog

## Unreleased

- Added a fixed I Asgard I raid-plan loader so guild members can refresh the
  maintained plan without exchanging another long share link.
- Added automatic new-version detection using the deployed Git revision.
- Added the Git revision and this changelog beneath the application version.
- Added compact Discord and Twitch icons alongside the Raider.IO and support
  links in Pestivator's creator card. Discord now opens the application instead
  of the misleading private-messages route.
- Shared raid plans now replace stale locally saved assignments before the
  first render and remain active after a clean reload. The same loaded plan is
  passed into live Intermission, both Phase 2 assignments, Phase 3, and the
  shared Phase 4 roster.
- Phase 3 NPC movement, landing groups, crystal-light ownership, opening-side
  scoring, and safe-zone scoring now follow the loaded raid plan.

## 0.1.0

- Initial public movement trainer with Intermission, Phase 2, Phase 3, and
  Phase 4 practice; editable and shareable raid plans; Test through Hard
  difficulties; configurable controls and HUD; scoring; failure review; and a
  shareable completion certificate.
